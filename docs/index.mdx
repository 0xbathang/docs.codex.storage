## Features

### Fast erasure coding

Codex uses high-performance Reed-Solomon encoding to guarantee the durability of the datasets.

### SNARK-based proof of retrievability

To implement space-efficient data retrievability, Codex leverages state-of-the-art SNARK-based proofs.

### Low-overhead lazy repair

Data repairs in Codex are grouped through lazy repair to decrease network bandwidth overhead.

### Data Availability Sampling

Codex samples datasets frequently to guarantee data durability in a Byzantine environment.
